# ML-Perceptron-SVM-DecisionTrees

The  Boolean  satisfiability  problem (also  referred  to  as  SAT)  is  the  problem  of  figuring  out  if there  exists  an  interpretation  that  satisfies  a  given  Boolean formula.  It  is  the  first  problem  to  be  proven  to  be  NP-Complete. The project examines the ability of neural networks to reason structurally and abstractly using propositional logic. The algorithms used to solve SAT problem: Multi-layer perceptron, linear SVM, Decision Trees and Naive Bayes
